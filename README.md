# Flink - PHP Magic ORM Library

**Development has been discontinued and further use is not recommended.**

This project was a great learning experience for me and I formerly used it for a couple of personal projects. However, it does not meet my current standards for safety and code quality and I would not recommend using it for any new projects, especially not for production.

## About the project

Flink is a Library for automatic database entity mapping, fully functioning by magic methods.
Entities are represented by classes which extend the `Entity` class. Each Entity requires a corresponding list and mapper class and can be used to automatically map database entries to objects and vice versa.
